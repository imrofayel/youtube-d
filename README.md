`ffmpeg` must be installed on your system for merging video and audio streams.

1. Install **Python 3.x & pip**.

2. Download [`ffmpeg-git-essentials.7z`](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) and extract the downloaded file in `C:\` and rename the extracted folder to `ffmpeg`. Add `C:\ffmpeg\bin` to your system's **PATH** (User variables) environment variable.
   
3. **Clone** the repository and create a **virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   activate the **virtual environment** by running
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
     ```
     and then install **dependencies**, if any dependency isn't there, dont worry `python 🐍` gonna tell you.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
4. **そうそう** you good to go. Run `python app.py` and download unlimited videos.

⚠️ Dependencies could be outdated in `requirements.txt` so update these manually.

It's open-source under **MIT**.

*Here's the screenshot btw.*
